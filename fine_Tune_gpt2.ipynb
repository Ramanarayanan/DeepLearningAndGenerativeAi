I will then continue training GPT-2 model on a dataset of cooking recipes, enabling it to generate recipes based on input ingredients.

        "Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are trained on a general, diverse corpus and they offer many capabilities but aren’t universal. You don’t want the model to respond in the most general way based on the general uses of particular words on the Internet. Fine-tuning starts from an existing pre-trained model and continues training on a specialized corpus to shift the parameters to achieve better loss on a specific task. In this article, I will fine-tune GPT2 model, which already understands English language, on a cooking recipes corpus, enabling the model to generate recipes based on input ingredients. This application of fine-tuning enhances the model’s capability in domain-specific tasks without starting the training process from scratch, which can be extremely time-consuming and computationally expensive.\n",

        "Supervised fine-tuning is a technique where you train the LLM on a dataset of data that contains labels. This task could be sentiment analysis, text summarization, translation, etc.\n",
        "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a technique where you use human feedback to fine-tune the LLM. The basic idea is that you give the LLM a prompt and it generates an output. Then, you ask a human to rate the output.\n",
        "There are 3 options for parameter training:\n",
        "\n",
        "Full Fine-tuning: Updates all parameters of the pre-trained model on the new dataset, allowing models to learn task-specific details while retaining their general knowledge. Partial Fine-Tuning updates final few layers or specific parts like the attention heads.\n",
        "Transfer Learning with Task-Specific Layers: Adds new task-specific layers (e.g., classification heads) on top of the LLM. Only these new layers are trained.\n",
        "Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT): Add small, trainable components or adapt only a fraction of the model’s parameters.\n",

        "First, let’s install the transformers package from Hugging Face which will give us a PyTorch interface for working with GPT-2 pre-trained model. We also need some libraries for data processing and model optimization using PyTorch. I have opted for the gpt2-medium variant with 345 million parameters so I can run on my computer equipped with an RTX2080. I recommend to execute the code on a computer or Colab notebook with a GPU supporting CUDA for optimal performance.\n",

        "Nucleus sampling is similar to Top-K sampling. Instead of focusing on Top-K words, nucleus sampling focuses on the smallest possible sets of Top-V words such that the sum of their probability is ≥ p. Then, the tokens that are not in V^(p) are set to 0; the rest are re-scaled to ensure that they sum to 1. The intuition is that when the model is very certain on some tokens, the set of potential candidate tokens is small, otherwise, more potential candidate tokens are needed to have sum of probability to exceed p.\n",
