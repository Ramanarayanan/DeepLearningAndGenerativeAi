        "Cosine Similarity between 'dog' and 'cat': Since both \"dog\" and \"cat\" are semantically close (both are animals), their cosine similarity is high (around 0.92), and the cosine distance is low (around 0.08).\n",
        "Cosine Similarity between 'Happiness' and 'Joyful': \"Happiness\" and \"Joyful\" are related but not as directly related as \"dog\" and \"cat\", so the similarity is a bit lower (around 0.76), and the distance is higher (around 0.24).\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        "Cosine Similarity and Cosine Distance are inversely related: if the similarity is high, the distance will be low, and vice versa.\n",
