There, the dialysis workflow of the treatments of 12 patients was analyzed for two nurses before and after the implementation of the Therapy Monitor. The study followed two approaches in order to identify the benefits of TMon for its users and the patients. The measurement of all dialysis related process times allowed for a quantitative analysis, whereas interviews with doctors and nurses formed the qualitative part of the study"

Overall, the workflow optimization and speed up of the processes results in a saving of approximately 25 minutes or 40% per dialysis treatment. This finally leads to more patient comfort and less stress for nursing staff."
